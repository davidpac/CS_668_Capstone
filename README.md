# CS_668_Capstone

**Problem/ Opportunity:**

-	Is it possible to build a price prediction model for each of the app categories ?
-	Is there any correlation between free/not free and "in-app purchase" apps ?
-	Is there any correlation between the length of app name and price?
-	When consumers buy apps on the google play store, to what extent do they consider the   developers of those apps ?
-	Does high rating lead to high installation ?

**Goal:**

-	The main goal is to first identify correlation between price and the other variables such as app categories, app rating, and content rating. In addition to that, a separate analysis will be made to explore any correlation between the length of app name and the price set to the app. Finally, a price prediction model will be built in order to predict prices on different app categories.

**Objectives:**

1.	Collect data for google apps
2.	Clean the dataset (R, Python)
3.	Perform ANOVA analysis in order to discover correlations between different variables (R, Python)
4.	Visualize the findings (Tableau, Python, R)
5.	Build a model for price prediction
 
**** Success Criteria:****
 
-	After exploratory analysis is made and a prediction model is built, the model will be evaluated to make sure its accuracy.
Assumptions, Risks, Obstacles:
-	The primary obstacle is that the dataset is confined within google play store. Having an app store alongside a play store would be better for comparison. In addition, in-app purchase prices are not indicated. That might be a major problem for identifying the cost range of free apps with “in-app purchase”
